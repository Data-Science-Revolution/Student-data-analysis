# Student-data-analysis
A project to study students across Indian states 
My project objective was to comprehensively analyze the educational landscape in India, with a primary focus on the student population, gender distribution, dropout rates, and their relationship with poverty levels across states. This project aims to provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities in India's education system, facilitating data-driven decisions for policymakers, educators, and stakeholders.
